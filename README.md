# STAT6031

# Project Goal:
Accurately predict the price of a given AirBNB rental in __<<< CITY NAME >>>__, given the metadata about each property.

# 


# Our Model
TBD

[Caret](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-predictive-models-in-r-with-caret-12baf9941236) is a great general purpose regression/machine learning library in R.

- Train/test splitting
- Cross validation
- Pre-processing

### Possible supplemental data:
  - Lat-long of top 10 TripAdvisor destinations in the area ("# within walking distance")
  - Crime rates ("Do I really want to stay in this area?")
  - Local rental rates ("How expensive is an equivalent apartment in that area?")'

# TODO 
1) Clean out duplicates/bad data
2) Decide which variables to keep/model
3) EDA
4) Model selection
5) Validation
6) Report writing
